I am a third-year PhD student at Aarhus University in the Department of Mechanical and Production Engineering.
I studied first Pure Mathematics (BSc) and then Applied Mathematics (MSc) at University of Pisa.
My research interests include:
- Scientific Machine Learning
- Explainable AI for Science
- Symbolic Regression
- Computational Physics

When I am not working, I usually play some videogames, watch some animated series or improve my AI knowledge
with some youtube videos.
